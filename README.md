# GitHub Extension

This is a [WebExtension] that indicates when you're in a _non_ private GitHub repository.

## Installation

Pick the [latest release](https://github.com/klingtnet/github-webextension/releases/latest) and click on the `*.xpi` asset.  Firefox, or any other browser that supports WebExtensions, should then ask you if you want to install the extension.

## Development

Use [web-ext] for automatic loading and re-loading of the extension.
I recommend [direnv] and [nvm] for the local development setup.
Afterwards you can just run

```sh
$ npm install
```

to install all dependencies.
